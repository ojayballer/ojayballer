## 🔍 About Me  
I learn best by building. Over the past year, I’ve been applying ML fundamentals and core software engineering to real-world projects — from **predicting housing prices** to **managing student attendance systems**.  

- 🔭 Currently working on: **Trash Image Classifier** (1600+ images, classical ML pipeline)  
- ✅ Built:  
  • **Bengaluru House Price Predictor** (end-to-end regression + Flask app)  
  • **Attendance Management System** (Java Swing + MySQL backend)  
- 🌱 Learning: **Deep Learning basics (CNNs, RNNs, NLP)**  
- 🎯 Goal: Grow into an **ML Engineer/Researcher**, contributing to impactful AI-driven projects
