## The Mission

I don't just use frameworks. I build them to understand them. Currently a third year Computer Science student at the University of Lagos, focused on understanding how ML systems actually work under the hood. Every project is intentional, designed to master fundamentals rather than just add to a portfolio.

Right now I'm deep in building neural networks from absolute scratch. No shortcuts, no black boxes. Just pure mathematics, gradient flows, and raw compute. The goal is true proficiency in foundations before touching production systems.

**Current Focus**: Architecting RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers in JAX from first principles, then moving into computational deep learning, GPU optimization, and hardware level ML engineering.

**Future Direction**: Game development, robotics, and hardware systems. Building things that exist at the intersection of intelligence and physical reality.

## What I'm Building

```python
class CurrentJourney:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phase = "Foundation Mastery"
        self.current_projects = [
            "RNN from scratch (JAX)",
            "LSTM architecture (JAX)", 
            "GRU networks (JAX)",
            "Transformer model (JAX)"
        ]
        self.next_level = [
            "GPU/CUDA optimization",
            "Hardware accelerated ML",
            "Computational deep learning",
            "Game dev and robotics"
        ]
    
    def philosophy(self):
        return "Build it. Break it. Understand it. Master it."
```

**Why JAX?** Learning functional programming paradigms, automatic differentiation internals, and preparing for GPU level optimization work. Starting simple with just JAX.numpy, gradually incorporating advanced features as I earn them.

## Beyond the Code

When I'm not architecting neural networks or debugging backpropagation flows, you'll find me following Liverpool FC. Been a supporter for 8 years through every high and low. YNWA.

I watch a lot of anime, mainly Naruto and other classics. Also into shows like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. There's something about great storytelling that always pulls me in, whether it's on screen or in the patterns hidden in data.

Recently I've been getting interested in game development and robotics. The idea of building intelligent systems that interact with the physical world is fascinating. That's where I see myself heading after I master these foundations.

## Connect

I'm always down to discuss ML architectures, optimization techniques, or the latest Liverpool match. Let's build something together.
