## 🎯 THE MISSION

I don't just use frameworks — I build them to understand them. Currently a third-year Computer Science student at the University of Lagos, obsessed with understanding how ML systems actually work under the hood. Every project is intentional: designed to master fundamentals, not just add to a portfolio.

Right now, I'm deep in the trenches building neural networks from absolute scratch. No shortcuts. No black boxes. Just pure mathematics, gradient flows, and raw compute. The goal? True proficiency in foundations before touching production systems.

**Current Focus**: Architecting RNNs, LSTMs, and Transformers in JAX from first principles → Moving into computational deep learning, GPU optimization, and hardware-level ML engineering.

**Future Trajectory**: Game development, robotics, and hardware systems. Building things that exist at the intersection of intelligence and physical reality.

## 🔥 WHAT I'M BUILDING

```python
class CurrentJourney:
    def __init__(self):
        self.phase = "Foundation Mastery"
        self.current_projects = [
            "RNN from scratch (JAX)",
            "LSTM architecture (JAX)", 
            "GRU networks (JAX)",
            "Transformer model (JAX)"
        ]
        self.next_level = [
            "GPU/CUDA optimization",
            "Hardware-accelerated ML",
            "Computational deep learning",
            "Game dev & robotics"
        ]
    
    def philosophy(self):
        return "Build it. Break it. Understand it. Master it."
```

**Why JAX?** Learning functional programming paradigms, automatic differentiation internals, and preparing for GPU-level optimization work. Starting simple (just JAX.numpy), gradually incorporating advanced features as I earn them.

## 🌍 BEYOND THE CODE

When I'm not architecting neural networks or debugging backpropagation flows, you'll find me:

**⚽ Following Liverpool FC** — 8 years of loyalty through every high and low. YNWA.

**🎌 Watching anime** — Naruto hit different. Currently rewatching the classics and exploring new series.

**📺 Binging peak television** — Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, and anything with compelling storytelling. Great narratives teach you how to structure systems.

**🎮 Developing interest in game dev** — Starting to explore the intersection of AI, physics engines, and interactive experiences.

**🤖 Fascinated by robotics & hardware** — The next frontier. Intelligence meeting physical reality.

There's something about understanding systems — whether it's a neural network, a football tactic, or a perfectly written scene — that just clicks. Pattern recognition works everywhere.
